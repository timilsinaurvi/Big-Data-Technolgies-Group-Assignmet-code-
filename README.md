This project uses PySpark to perform end-to-end telecom analytics, including data cleaning, feature engineering, churn label encoding, and session-based transformations. It builds machine-learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer churn and analyzes network congestion by examining traffic and resource utilization. The project also evaluates service plan profitability by calculating revenue patterns and customer distribution. Designed to run in Google Colab, it demonstrates scalable big-data processing and real-world telecom insight generation in a clean, efficient workflow.
